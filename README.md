# Single Page PHP Mail Form
I would update this project irregularly to increase my knowledge and skills of PHP.
In order to focus on coding PHP, I simply created front-end pages with bootstrap 4.
This is my private project, but I always welcome to receive suggestions and inquiries.

# Absolutely plain PHP code without any frameworks or plug-ins.
To study how does PHP work in sending emails, I avoided using any useful libraries and plug-ins.
